title:  "Meet Ivy"

I've not posted anything on this site since October as many things have happened in the past 6 months

- I left my old employer after 3 and a half years and made sure my handover was as top notch as possible
- I started my new role as a Technical Lead in November
- Uni started back up in October which takes priority over all side projects

And finally in December, we brought home our Golden Retriever Ivy.
