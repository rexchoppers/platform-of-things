# Overview
I've had a fair few years with AWS now so I've been collecting certifications like they're Pokémon. DVA-C02 is another certification from AWS, this time focusing on everything development. 

# Preparation
Once again, I used the following Udemy courses to study for this certification:

# Exam
The exam itself was pretty straightforward—online and proctored. Unlike CLF-C02, I got straight into my exam without any waiting or issues. 

The exam itself is:

- 65 questions to answer. 
- 100 minutes to complete.
- Multiple choice questions.
- Few curveball questions as you'd expect

I finished in around 40 minutes. This exam does not provide a pass/fail score straight away. This is given to you in an email a few hours/days later.

This exam was harder than CLF-C02. Even with vast amounts of preperation, the way the questions are worded can be tricky. Exam practice will be key to passing this exam and I would recommend doing as many practice exams as possible.

# Conclusion
If you're looking for an easy introduction into AI as a whole, this is a good exam to start from. It'll teach you a lot of basic concepts and give you a good understanding of the AWS AI services.
