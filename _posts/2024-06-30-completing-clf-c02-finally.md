title:  "Completing CLF-C02 (Finally)"
---

# Overview
Finally, after 6 years of experience using AWS, GCP, and a sprinkling of Azure, I've completed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. With job swaps, loads of projects, and general life bits, I've finally gotten around to completing it.

With my experience using many different services on AWS, GCP, and Azure, I thought it was probably a good time to put pen to paper and get the certification. This won't be the only certification I'll be getting; next will be the AWS Certified Developer - Associate. And then, who knows?

# Preparation
I prepared for this exam last year but for the old specification (CLF-C01). I didn't end up taking the exam as I was busy with other things. When I picked this back up a month ago, I found out that the exam had changed to CLF-C02. With a quick refresh, I was ready to take the exam.

I used the following resources to prepare for the exam:
- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Training Notes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08RR5ZC1P?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Tests](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08F6LDVD3?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

Whilst I have used online resources and courses in the past, for myself, a distraction free resource like a book is the best way for me to learn. It's an "traditional" way of learning, but it works.

# Exam
The exam itself was pretty straightforwardâ€”online and proctored. My only advice would be to give yourself plenty of time to prepare for the exam itself. Check-in time was at 19:15 and the exam started at 19:45. However, due to the number of people taking the exam, I didn't start until 20:25 as I was in a queue to start the exam. This is something to consider when booking the exam.

The exam itself is:

- 65 questions to answer. 
- 90 minutes to complete the exam.
- Multiple choice questions.
- Few curveball questions as you'd expect

I finished the exam in around 20 minutes. With this particular exam, it provides you with a pass/fail result at the end of the exam.

# Conclusion
Overall, a straightforward exam that provides a comprehensive overview of the AWS services. I'd recommend this exam to anyone who is looking to get into cloud computing or is looking to get a certification to back up their experience.

My advice especially if you're new to cloud computing is to get some hands-on experience with the services. AWS provides a free tier for 12 months which is more than enough time to get some hands-on experience with the services. It's all good knowing the theory, but practical experience is key.
