title:  "AWMS is going open source"
---

# Background
AWMS (A warehouse management system) will be going open-source. I've been working on this project for a couple of years now with the intention of marketing it as a SaaS product. However, over the past few weeks, I've decided to make it a completely open-source project.

# Why
- I have taken a lot from the open-source community over the past few years. It's probably my turn to give something back
- I'll be working on other closed-source projects to generate revenue, so I'm not concerned with losing anything from making this project open-source.
- Anyone can contribute features
- Anyone can take this project and make it their own for their requirements
- Because...Why not?

# Some goals for AWMS
- Scale well
- Integrate a simple customisation engine, even if the software doesn't fit your business's requirements initially...It will do after some configuration.
- Keep up with the times in terms of technology.
- Reporting functionality as standard (Not a bolt-on module for £££)

# Next Steps
Over the next few months, I'll gradually make specific components and projects open-source. Any announcements will be made on this site and LinkedIn.

# Final Words
There are a lot of challenges to making this project open source, and initially, it won't be perfect. But hopefully, it'll get there :)
