title:  "Adventures Through Visonic's Powermaster GTX EEPROM"
---

# Overview
In late 2023, I purchased a  Powermaster GTX alarm system which so far has been a great little system for my home (Previous post can be found [here](/2023/09/20/visonic-powermaster-gtx-compact-review)).

Shortly afterwards, I also bought a Powerlink 3.1 module of eBay for Â£30 which means the panel is now able to connect to the internet and be controlled via the Visonic Go mobile app. The Powerlink module exposed a JSON-RPC API on port 8181 which I started to document at: [https://rexchoppers.github.io/visonic-pmaxservice-docs](https://rexchoppers.github.io/visonic-pmaxservice-docs)

I'm currently using Visonic (Tyco's) free PowerManage server that allows you to connect your panel to the internet and control it via the Visonic Go mobile app. However, I'm not a fan of the fact that the panel is now reliant on a third party server to function. So I've done a bit of digging and whilst I don't have a solution yet, I'm hoping to find a way to create some self-hosted alternatives to the PowerManage server. Either that or use home assistant
