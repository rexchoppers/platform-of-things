It's going well. After a small learning curve with Keycloak and deciding on a decent project structure, it's going well.

The first steps involve working on the absolute basics, which are relatively easy to do (mostly CRUD endpoints) and integrating them into the front end. After that, I'll explore some of the more ambitious features planned for AWMS, such as the delivery note designer, rules system, and the mobile app.

Keep in mind that all elements of this project are heavily under development and are subject to change.
