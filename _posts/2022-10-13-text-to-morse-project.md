title:  "Text To Morse Project"
---

# Background
Back in 2018 and inspired by the Youtube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRN2nP_9dA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRN2nP_9dA) which shows the full morse code transmissions of the Titanic's last moments; I decided to make a fun project in Java + JavaFX to convert text to morse code.

Surprisingly simple, and quite humbling to see how far we've come in terms of communication. This is one of the last Java projects I've worked on. I hope to come back to do more Java one day or start with Kotlin/Scala.
