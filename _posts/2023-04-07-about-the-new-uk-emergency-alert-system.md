# Background
On the 23rd of April 2023, the UK government will perform a nationwide test of its new emergency alert system launched on the 19th of March 2023.

The system will make a loud siren and then read out the message sent. A video of this alert can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmdqHLekkBQ)

It is thought the system will be used to alert the public on emergencies in the area, such as:

-	Flooding
-	Terrorist attacks
-	Fire
-	Other extreme weather events

The system uses a technology called “cell broadcast” that can broadcast a message to compatible devices without requiring information such as an address or mobile number.

## Holy Shit
From looking on social media, word of mouth and public forums, it seems the general reaction has been highly negative towards the rollout of this new system. I think the images below explain the response well.
