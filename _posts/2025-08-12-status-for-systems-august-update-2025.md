title:  "Status For Systems - August Update (2025)"
---

# Background
2022 was the last time I updated on the Status For Systems project. It was a project I was flying through until life got in the way (New job, dog, the usual things really)

Since then, I've had a chance to reflect on the project and its goals. There's a need for a simple, open-source status page solution that can be easily integrated with existing systems. 

Last month, I have re-jigged the full project and working towards an initial first release towards the end of this year.

# Tech Stack
The technology stack has evolved for this project. It current uses:

- Frontend: Flutter (Web)
- Backend: Typescript (NestJS)
- Database: MongoDB

# Features To Implement (Not all for initial release)
- User authentication
- System probes
- Incident management
- Notification system
- Metrics

# Contributing
Please contribute if you want. This project will remain open source, forever, for all to use with the potential for a SaaS solution later on if there's a need for it.
