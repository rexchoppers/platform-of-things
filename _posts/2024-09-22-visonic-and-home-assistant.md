title:  "Visonic & Home Assistant"
---

# Overview
Whilst I try to push forward to find the god-forsaken encryption keys for the Powermaster GTX so I can create a self-hosted alternative to the PowerManage server, I've been looking at integrating the panel with Home Assistant. Completely based in Python, I will start contributing to the Home Assistant Visonic component to add support for more sensors, features and I hope to eventually do configuration via the Home Assistant UI.

My first addition if approved will be adding glass break sensors to the Visonic component. I'll add more sensors as long as I keep caving into my addiction of buying shit from eBay.
