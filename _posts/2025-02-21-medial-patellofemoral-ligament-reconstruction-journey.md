# Overview
First of all, this isn't medical advice. And I am definitely not smart enough to be a doctor (Nor do I have the A-Levels) Please use this as a bit of a guide through my journey. Whilst I can't speak for everyone, this is my experience and I hope it helps you in some way.

All MRI + X-Ray images you see below are my own and have been requested from the hospital. Of course, all personal information has been removed from them.

# Background
I've always had a weird left knee. Starting from around the age of 9, I could tell when playing football that it would sort of move a bit too much. Not enough to completely dislocate but enough to cause some discomfort. However, being a child, I didn't really care. Even during high school, I took a bad tackle to the knee and felt it "move" but again thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to 2019/2020 when playing five-a-side, it started to move more than usual. But once again, it wasn't causing any problems so I did not seek medical advice.

# Problems Start

- #### First Subluxation
In 2021, I was at a wedding where the first subluxation occurred. I was dancing (Under the influence of the strongest drink known to man - Bud Light) and my knee just gave up. The best way to describe it, my body moved right but the knee cap moved left. 
The pain was instant. Excruciating. The swelling and pain stayed for around 2 weeks before it started to subside. I did see a doctor who said everything structurally was fine and it was likely a one-off. Plenty of rest, ice and naproxen helped (And rotted my stomach lining but that's a different story)

- #### Second Subluxation
Still in 2021, Christmas party. I was dancing again (This time a bit more sober) and the same thing happened. Suprisingly, the pain wasn't as bad as the first time. It still hurt but I could walk on it. This time though was the start of the realisation that something was wrong. Throughout the end of 2021 and 2022, I was more careful on it knowing that it could happen again and avoiding certain movements.

- #### Third Subluxation
July 2023. After giving my knee a lot of rest and avoiding certain movements, I was in Manchester and went to run to catch up with someone. The only way I can describe it is my leg extended, my knee felt like it had more movement, it moved and I put all weight on it. All in the matter of a second. I dropped to the floor like a sack of crap and the pain was unbearable. My manager put me in a taxi back to the hotel and I spent the night in agony. Waking up was even worse - The knee had swollen up triple its size; full weight bearing was impossible and the pain was the worst I've ever felt. Something was wrong. Following my gut, I called a close friend, and got karted off to A&E.

# A&E - The Start of the Journey
Before I start, I just want to say that the staff who work in the NHS are absolutely amazing. It's a shame the system is a political warzone. I believe as long as you're polite and respectful, they will do everything they can to help you. Make sure to push for what you think is right. I had a lot of gut feelings throughout this process and I'm glad I listened to them.

Manchester Royal Infirmary A&E. After explaining to triage, I was sent to the fracture clinic for an X-Ray.
