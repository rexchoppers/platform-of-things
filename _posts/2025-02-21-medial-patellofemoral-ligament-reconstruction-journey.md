# Overview
First of all, this isn't medical advice. And I am definitely not smart enough to be a doctor (Nor do I have the A-Levels) Please use this as a bit of a guide through my journey. Whilst I can't speak for everyone, this is my experience and I hope it helps you in some way.

All MRI + X-Ray images you see below are my own and have been requested from the hospital. Of course, all personal information has been removed from them.

# Background
I've always had a weird left knee. Starting from around the age of 9, I could tell when playing football that it would sort of move a bit too much. Not enough to completely dislocate but enough to cause some discomfort. However, being a child, I didn't really care. Even during high school, I took a bad tackle to the knee and felt it "move" but again thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to 2019/2020 when playing five-a-side, it started to move more than usual. But once again, it wasn't causing any problems so I did not seek medical advice.

# Problems Start

- #### First Subluxation
In 2021, I was at a wedding where the first subluxation occurred. I was dancing (Under the influence of the strongest drink known to man - Bud Light) and my knee just gave up. The best way to describe it, my body moved right but the knee cap moved left. 
The pain was instant. Excruciating. The swelling and pain stayed for around 2 weeks before it started to subside. I did see a doctor who said everything structurally was fine and it was likely a one-off. Plenty of rest, ice and naproxen helped (And rotted my stomach lining but that's a different story)

- #### Second Subluxation
