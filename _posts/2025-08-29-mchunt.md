# Overview
In 2012, I started my programming journey. Like most teenagers at the time, I was drawn into games and I wanted to "Make a game" or "Make something for a game". I was heavily into Minecraft at this time and wanted to modify the game. Naive, I dove into learning Java. Yes, Java as a first programming language. Maybe that's why I'm going so grey in my 20s.

# BlockHunt
Teaming up with a friend, I helped develop and test one of the first "Hide and seek" server-side plugins. BlockHunt was born out of the love for the game but also, that was just the "thing" at the time. GMOD, Call of Duty, and other games had similar modes, and we wanted to bring that experience to this particular game.
